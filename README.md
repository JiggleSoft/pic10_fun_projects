## Why?

  * Why not?
  * It is fun to make cool stuff.
  * MCU is very cheap at approx. 50 pence each in small quantities.
  * Very limited resources (RAM,ROM,Stack,I/O):
    * Less to learn and remember.
      * Data Sheet is 88 pages for PIC10F200/202/204/206 ([Download](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40001239F.pdf)).
    * Small ROM allows practical development in assembly language.
	  * Programs are limited in size so assembly language is practical.
	  * Get an appreciation of what is going on inside the CPU.
	* Learn to squeeze and make best use of every available resource.
	  * This is missing from the software these days where 3GHz multi-core CPUs with vast RAM and storage can be thrown at problems.
    * Simpler projects, so are quick to build.
  * Available in PDIP so no SMT soldering required.
  * Circuits can be wired on breadboards and made in classrooms.
  * PCB layouts are Stripboard friendly so no custom PCBs are necessary.

## Completed Projects

  * General 
    * Microchip PIC10 (and PIC12) Programming ZIF Socket Board.
      * Allows out-of-circuit programming of PIC10 and PIC12 MCU's via a PICKit 2,3,4, or any compatible programmer ([Buy](https://new.microchipdirect.com/product/search/all/pg164140)).

## Work-In-Progress

  * General 
    * Microchip PIC10 General Purpose Development Board.
      * General purpose board that can be built in various flavours to support wiring up projects on a bench with jumper leads.
  * Visible Light Emitting Diode (LED)
   * Flashing LED Test Program.
   * Morse Code Beacon.
   * Mood Light (RGB).
   * Matrix 8x8 with MAX7219 driver.
  * Joke
    * IR LED Annoying Covert Possessed Remote Control.
